  ## Collection jitter is used to jitter the collection by a random amount.

  ## timestamp order as the collection interval, with the maximum being 1s.
  ##   ie, when interval = "10s", precision will be "1s"
  ##       when interval = "250ms", precision will be "1ms"
  ## Precision will NOT be used for service inputs. It is up to each individual
  ## service input to set the timestamp at the appropriate precision.

  ## written to, if there is no log activity rotation may be delayed.

  ## Address to listen on

  ## Metric version controls the mapping from Telegraf metrics into
  ## Prometheus format.  When using the prometheus input, use the same value in
  ## both plugins to ensure metrics are round-tripped without modification.
  ##
  ##   example: metric_version = 1; deprecated in 1.13
  ##            metric_version = 2; recommended version
  # metric_version = 1

  ## Path to publish the metrics on.
  # path = "/metrics"

  ## Expiration interval for each metric. 0 == no expiration
  # expiration_interval = "60s"

  ## Collectors to enable, valid entries are "gocollector" and "process".
  ## If unset, both are enabled.

  ## Send string metrics as Prometheus labels.
  ## Unless set to false all string metrics will be sent as labels.

  ## If set, enable TLS with the given certificate.
